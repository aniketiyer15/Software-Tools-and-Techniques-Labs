The task which our group chose was :

**Changing the main method to take a command-line argument**

* `<Esc>` : Gets us out of `insert` mode
* `:wq<Enter>` : Saves the changes made and exits `vim`

## Part 2

It took me 5 seconds to make the edits on VS Code whereas it took me 15 seconds to make the edits using vim. I did not face any difficulties while making the edits!!

I would prefer using vim while making edits remotely. This is because if I was to edit multiple files on VS Code, then scp the files to the remote computer, it would take a long time. Instead I could use vim on the remote machine and make the edits on the remote machine itself! It would help me save a lot of time

Time would be an important factor. Making edits on vim might take a little more time than making edits on VS Code. But at the end of the day, I would be saving lots of time as there is no need to `scp` the files (which takes a considerable amount of time). In class we are working with only a handful of files. But while working for a company or working in projects, we would have to handle multiple files and that could take a long time!!
